# Disassembly of Castle Master II: The Crypt

Disassembly of the original 1990 Castle Master II: The Crypt ZX Spectrum game by Incentive Software Ltd., 1990

Disassembled by Santiago Ontañón in 2023

Files:
- castlemaster2-annotated.asm: this is the main disassembly file. It contains my best effort at annotating and commenting the original source code.
- castlemaster2-original.asm: this is the raw disassembly of the game, with all the code and data areas already identified, but with no comments or annotations.
- loader-annotated.asm: the game loader disassembly with a few comments and annotations. I used the disassembly capabilities of MDL ( https://github.com/santiontanon/mdlz80optimizer ) for generating this file.
- loader-original.asm: this is the raw disassembly of the game loader.

You can see an HTML-rendered version of the disassembly, with syntax highlighting, and some visualization of the graphics here: https://braingames.santiontanon.dev/games/disassembly/castlemaster2/castlemaster2-annotated.html

All the symbol names and comments in this file are my own interpretation of the original source code, they could be wrong. So, take them all with a grain of salt! And if you see any errors, please report!
